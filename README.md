This dataset is taken from the UCI machine learning website. This dataset contains medical information on patients and the diagnosis results of whether the patient has heart disease. Machine learning models are necessary to determine whether a patient has heart disease and speed up the diagnostic process based on the medical information provided about that patient. The variables that most influence a patient to have heart disease will also be explored more deeply in this notebook.
📌 **Notebook Objectives**
This notebook aims to:
Perform dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
Build machine learning model that can predict patients status.
Export prediction result on test data into files.
Save/dump the complete machine learing pipeline for later usage.
Perform prediction on new example data given and export the prediction result.
